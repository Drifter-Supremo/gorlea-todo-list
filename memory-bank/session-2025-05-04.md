## Overdue Tasks and Date Handling Improvements

1. **Preventing Past Dates in AI Task Creation**
   - **Problem**: The AI could create tasks with dates and times that had already passed.
   - **Solution**: 
     - Enhanced the `resolveDate` function in `src/lib/parseTask.ts` to detect and adjust past dates
     - Added logic to handle different scenarios:
       - If a time on the current day has passed, move it to tomorrow
       - If a date in the past is specified, increment days until it's in the future
       - Updated the fallback date logic to use tomorrow at 9am if current time is past 9am

2. **Improved Handling of Overdue Tasks**
   - **Problem**: Overdue tasks weren't clearly labeled or prioritized in the task list.
   - **Solution**:
     - Modified `formatDueDate` in `components/task-row.tsx` to display "Overdue" for past due tasks
     - Enhanced task sorting in `components/task-list.tsx` to prioritize overdue tasks at the top
     - Maintained the existing red badge for overdue tasks for visual emphasis

## Code Changes

### 1. Date Resolution (`src/lib/parseTask.ts`)
- Added checks to detect if a parsed date is in the past
- Implemented logic to adjust past dates to future dates
- Updated the fallback date logic to ensure it's always in the future

### 2. Task Display (`components/task-row.tsx`)
- Added "Overdue" label for past due tasks
- Maintained the red badge color for visual emphasis

### 3. Task Sorting (`components/task-list.tsx`)
- Implemented a new sorting algorithm that prioritizes:
  1. Overdue tasks first
  2. Then tasks sorted by due date (earliest first)
  3. Tasks without due dates last

## Testing Results

- Tasks created with past dates are now automatically adjusted to future dates
- Overdue tasks are clearly labeled as "Overdue" with a red badge
- Overdue tasks appear at the top of the task list for better visibility
- All functionality works as expected with improved user experience

## Next Steps

1. Continue testing with various date inputs to ensure robust handling
2. Consider adding a dedicated "Overdue" section in the task list if the number of overdue tasks grows
3. Explore adding notifications or reminders for overdue tasks in future iterations
