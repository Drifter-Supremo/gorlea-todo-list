# Session Summary: May 3, 2025

## UI Improvements Implemented

1. **Chat Modal Enhancements**
   - **Problem**: The chat input field didn't wrap text, causing long messages to extend horizontally.
   - **Solution**: 
     - Replaced `Input` component with `Textarea` in `components/chat-modal.tsx`
     - Added proper styling for auto-wrapping and height constraints
     - Set `min-h-[40px]` and `max-h-[120px]` with `resize-none` for clean appearance
     - Used `rows={1}` for initial compact size

2. **Task Creation Confirmation**
   - **Problem**: After creating a task via AI chat, there was no clear confirmation before the modal closed.
   - **Solution**:
     - Added a clean, minimal confirmation message in the chat: "✅ Task created!"
     - Added a minimal toast notification with "✅ Task created"
     - Kept the chat modal open after task creation
     - Cleared the input field after sending a message

3. **Add Task Modal Behavior**
   - **Problem**: The add task modal stayed open after task creation, requiring an extra click to close.
   - **Solution**:
     - Modified `components/add-task-modal.tsx` to close automatically after task creation
     - Added `onClose()` call after successful task creation
     - Removed toast notification since the modal closes immediately

## Code Changes

### 1. Chat Modal (`components/chat-modal.tsx`)
- Replaced `Input` with `Textarea` component
- Changed input ref type from `HTMLInputElement` to `HTMLTextAreaElement`
- Added styling for the textarea with proper height constraints
- Modified the success flow to keep the modal open and show confirmation
- Added clean, minimal toast notification
- Simplified the AI response message

### 2. Add Task Modal (`components/add-task-modal.tsx`)
- Added automatic closing after task creation
- Removed unnecessary code and imports

## Testing Results

- Chat input now properly wraps text as you type
- Task creation via AI chat shows a clear confirmation message
- Add task modal now closes automatically after task creation
- All functionality works as expected with improved user experience

## Next Steps

1. Continue testing the AI task creation flow with various inputs
2. Consider implementing optimistic UI updates for AI task creation
3. Proceed with Phase 5 (email digest functionality) after confirming stability
