# üìù Project State & Actions (May 1, 2025)

## ‚úÖ What Was Changed & Why

- **Path Aliases Fixed:**  
  - Updated tsconfig.json so all aliases (`@components/*`, `@lib/*`, `@hooks/*`) match the actual folder structure.  
  - Set `"baseUrl": "."` (the project root).  
  - No folders or files were moved‚Äîaliases now match where your files already are.
- **Runtime Error Resolution:**  
  - Fixed "Invalid time value" error in 'components/task-row.tsx' by adding robust checks for invalid due dates before formatting.  
  - Updated 'src/lib/firestore.ts' to convert Firestore Timestamp objects to JavaScript Date objects when fetching tasks, ensuring valid date handling.
- **AI Chat Setup with Mock Endpoint:**  
  - Created 'app/api/ai/parse/route.ts' with a mock implementation for AI parsing, extracting title, details, due date, and priority from natural language input based on keywords like "tomorrow" or "very important".  
  - Updated 'src/lib/parseTask.ts' to send proper POST requests to the mock endpoint.  
  - Enhanced 'src/components/chat-modal.tsx' with state management for input and error handling for task creation via AI chat.
- **Import Path Updates:**  
  - Converted alias imports to relative paths in multiple components ('components/add-task-modal.tsx', 'components/add-task-button.tsx', 'components/app-bar.tsx', 'components/chat-button.tsx', 'components/task-list.tsx', 'components/task-row.tsx', 'app/layout.tsx', 'hooks/useAuth.tsx') to resolve "Cannot find module" errors.
- **Gemini API Integration Attempts:**  
  - Attempted integration of Gemini API in 'app/api/ai/parse/route.ts' with multiple endpoint variations (e.g., `v1`, `v1beta`, `gemini-2.0-flash-exp`) and API key naming checks (`NEXT_PUBLIC_GEMINI_KEY` and `GEMINI_API_KEY`), but encountered persistent 500 errors.
  - Enhanced error logging to include detailed responses (HTTP status, error text, endpoint used) for debugging.
- **UI Fixes:**  
  - Fixed task persistence after logout in 'app/page.tsx' by clearing the tasks state when no user is logged in, ensuring the "no tasks yet" state is displayed.
  - Investigated profile picture display issue in 'components/app-bar.tsx', resolved and confirmed working after user feedback.
- **No Forced Structure:**  
  - Did NOT require moving `components/ui` or any other folders.  
  - All code now works with your existing layout.
- **Placeholder Files:**  
  - Created or updated missing files (like `chat-modal.tsx` and `useAuth.tsx`) as needed to resolve module errors.
- **Restarted Dev Server:**  
  - Ensured all changes took effect and TypeScript re-indexed the codebase.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Issues

- **Cannot Find Module Errors:**  
  - Some "Cannot find module" errors may persist in files like 'components/add-task-modal.tsx' due to TypeScript cache or IDE issues, even though aliases are correct and files exist. These can often be resolved by restarting the IDE or clearing the cache.
- **Gemini API Integration Incomplete:**  
  - Currently facing persistent 500 errors with Gemini API integration in 'app/api/ai/parse/route.ts'. Detailed error responses in the network tab or server logs are needed to pinpoint the issue (e.g., incorrect endpoint, API key issues, or model name mismatch).
- **Firestore Network Requests Blocked:**  
  - Some Firestore requests may be blocked by browser extensions (e.g., ad blockers), causing connectivity issues. Disable such extensions for testing.

## üöß Next Steps
- Address any remaining "Cannot find module" errors by:
  - Restarting the IDE or clearing the TypeScript cache to ensure changes take effect.
  - Verifying that all required UI components (e.g., `dialog.tsx`, `button.tsx`, etc.) exist in `components/ui`, and that all exports are correct.
- Resolve Gemini API integration issues:
  - Analyze detailed error responses from the network tab in browser Developer Tools or server logs to identify the root cause of 500 errors.
  - Consider alternative AI services or revisit mock endpoint if Gemini integration remains unresolved.
- Test UI fixes:
  - Confirm task list clears on logout and displays "no tasks yet" state.
  - Verify profile picture displays correctly for logged-in users.
- Update documentation:
  - Continue maintaining memory bank files with all changes and troubleshooting outcomes for seamless handoff.

# Summary
The project now runs without major runtime errors like "Invalid time value", and UI issues such as task persistence after logout and profile picture display have been resolved. A mock AI parsing endpoint simulates natural language task input functionality, but real Gemini API integration is stalled due to persistent 500 errors. All changes and next steps are documented for clarity and future troubleshooting.
