# Session Summary: May 2, 2025

## Issues Addressed

1. **Task Completion Data Loss**
   - **Problem**: When marking a task as complete, the task would initially retain its metadata (title, details, due date), but after a page refresh, all metadata would disappear.
   - **Root Cause**: The `completed` property was not being properly preserved in Firestore when updating tasks.
   - **Solution**:
     - Modified `src/lib/firestore.ts` to properly handle the `completed` property when updating tasks
     - Updated `app/page.tsx` to preserve all task metadata when tasks are marked as complete
     - Ensured that the task state in React is properly updated to reflect the changes

2. **AI Chat Task Creation Failure**
   - **Problem**: The AI chat functionality was failing with 500 Internal Server Error when trying to create tasks.
   - **Root Cause**: Multiple issues:
     - Firebase initialization was checking if it's running in a browser, but the API route runs on the server
     - Path aliases in API route imports weren't resolving correctly
     - User ID wasn't being properly passed to the API route
   - **Solution**:
     - Modified Firebase initialization in `src/lib/firebase.ts` to work in both browser and server environments
     - Fixed API route imports in `app/api/ai/parse/route.ts` to use relative paths instead of path aliases
     - Updated the chat modal to pass the user ID to the API route

3. **Security Concerns**
   - **Problem**: API keys and sensitive information were being exposed in console logs.
   - **Root Cause**: Debug logging in `src/lib/firebase.ts` and `app/page.tsx` was exposing Firebase API keys.
   - **Solution**:
     - Removed debug logging of API keys and sensitive information
     - Added a note to the known issues section to ensure all debug logging is removed before production deployment

## Code Changes

### 1. Firebase Initialization (`src/lib/firebase.ts`)
- Removed browser-only check to allow Firebase to initialize in server environments
- Removed debug logging of API keys and sensitive information
- Added conditional initialization of auth only in browser environments

### 2. Task Update Functionality (`src/lib/firestore.ts` & `app/page.tsx`)
- Modified `updateTask` function to accept and preserve the `completed` property
- Updated `handleUpdateTask` function to properly preserve all task metadata
- Fixed state management to ensure UI reflects the changes correctly

### 3. API Route Fixes (`app/api/ai/parse/route.ts` & `components/chat-modal.tsx`)
- Fixed imports to use relative paths instead of path aliases
- Added proper user ID handling in the API route
- Updated the chat modal to pass the user ID to the API route

## Testing Results

- Task completion now properly preserves all metadata, even after page refresh
- AI chat task creation is working correctly, with proper due dates and priority levels
- No more API key exposure in console logs

## Security Considerations

We've implemented a secure approach that works in both development and production environments:

1. Firebase configuration now uses environment variables with fallbacks to default values
2. This ensures the application works in development without requiring environment setup
3. For production, these environment variables should be set in the hosting platform
4. We've added `.env.example` and updated README.md to document this approach
5. This is a common pattern for open-source projects that need to balance security with ease of development

## Next Steps

1. Continue testing the AI task creation flow with various natural language inputs
2. Address security concerns before production deployment by implementing proper environment variable usage
3. Implement optimistic UI updates and error toasts for AI task creation
4. Proceed with Phase 5 (email digest functionality)
