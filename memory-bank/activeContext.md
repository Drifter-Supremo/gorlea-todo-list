# Active Context: Gorlea Tasks

## Current Work Focus

- Integrated 'chrono-node' library for enhanced date and time parsing in natural language task input, complementing OpenAI's GPT-4.1-mini integration.
- Refactored codebase to address authentication issues, type harmonization, and accessibility improvements.
- Emphasizing testing of the latest updates to ensure stability and accuracy in task creation and date parsing.

## Recent Changes

- Installed 'chrono-node' and updated 'src/lib/parseTask.ts' to offload date parsing from AI to 'chrono-node', handling fuzzy phrases and providing default times (e.g., morning: 9:00, afternoon: 12:00, night/evening: 20:00).
- Updated 'app/api/ai/parse/route.ts' to use the new parsing logic and resolve dates with 'chrono-node', ensuring tasks are added to Firestore with correct date formats.
- Modified 'src/lib/firestore.ts' to remove client-side 'auth.currentUser' checks, accepting 'userId' as a parameter for server-side compatibility.
- Harmonized 'Task' and 'TaskInput' types in 'src/lib/types.ts', adding 'userId' for server-side use.
- Enhanced system prompt in 'src/lib/parseTask.ts' to reflect Gorlea as an energetic AI assistant, improving task description engagement.
- Added environment variable validation in 'src/lib/parseTask.ts' and 'src/lib/firebase.ts' to prevent runtime errors due to missing keys.
- Improved accessibility in 'components/chat-modal.tsx' and 'components/add-task-modal.tsx' by adding 'aria-describedby' to dialog components.

## Next Steps

1. Test the full task creation flow with 'chrono-node' integration to ensure accurate date parsing for scenarios like "tomorrow at 9am" (tomorrow at 9:00), "friday night" (next Friday at 20:00), and no date (default to today at 9:00).
2. Verify stability of authentication changes in server-side contexts to prevent 'AUTH_REQUIRED' errors during task addition via API.
3. Address any remaining UI or accessibility issues as reported by user feedback.
4. Continue with Phase 5 of the roadmap for daily email digest functionality after confirming stability of current updates.
5. Ensure all memory bank files are kept up-to-date with the latest state and testing outcomes for seamless handoff.

## Active Decisions & Considerations

- Prioritize comprehensive testing of 'chrono-node' integration to confirm accurate date and time extraction from natural language input.
- Monitor user feedback on the latest refactoring to ensure no new issues arise from authentication or type changes.
- Maintain documentation consistency with project style, focusing on detailed updates for testing phases to support future development.
