# Active Context: Gorlea Tasks

## Current Work Focus

- Integrating Gemini AI parsing (Phase 3) for natural language task input.
- All core CRUD, time picker, and mobile/desktop UX features are complete.
- Task cards now support a title and a details field, with truncation and a responsive details modal.
- On mobile, only the title and due date are shown; delete icon is hidden for a cleaner look.
- Long-press on mobile shows only the delete action.
- "Details" is used everywhere in the UI instead of "description."
- Documentation and memory bank are kept fully up to date for handoff.

## Recent Changes

- Task cards updated: support for details field, title truncation, and modal with full details and edit controls (responsive for mobile/desktop).
- Mobile view improved: only title and due date shown, delete icon hidden, long-press menu shows only delete.
- All UI labels now use "Details" instead of "Description."
- Completed all Phase 2 features: Firestore CRUD helpers, per-user storage, add/edit modal with time picker, mobile long-press actions, edit/delete improvements, minimal confirmation dialogs.
- All features committed and pushed to main branch.
- Documentation and MVP checklist updated.

## Next Steps

1. Integrate Gemini AI parsing and connect to task creation flow (Phase 3).
2. Establish daily email digest functionality.
3. Prepare for deployment and production testing.
4. Continue updating documentation and memory bank for seamless AI and human handoff.

## Active Decisions & Considerations

- Prioritize documentation to ensure smooth onboarding and memory continuity.
- Follow MVP roadmap phases sequentially.
- Use AI assistant for both user-facing features and internal productivity.
