# Active Context: Gorlea Tasks

## Current Work Focus

- Improved user experience with UI enhancements to the chat modal and add task modal.
- Fixed critical issues with Firebase initialization and task completion functionality to ensure proper operation in both browser and server environments.
- Addressed security concerns by removing API key exposure in console logs.
- Integrated 'chrono-node' library for enhanced date and time parsing in natural language task input, complementing OpenAI's GPT-4.1-mini integration.
- Refactored codebase to address authentication issues, type harmonization, and accessibility improvements.
- Emphasizing testing of the latest updates to ensure stability and accuracy in task creation and date parsing.

## Recent Changes

- Fixed Firebase initialization in 'src/lib/firebase.ts' to work in both browser and server environments, enabling AI task creation functionality.
- Modified 'src/lib/firestore.ts' to properly handle the 'completed' property when updating tasks, ensuring task metadata is preserved.
- Updated 'app/page.tsx' to preserve all task metadata when tasks are marked as complete, fixing the issue where completed tasks lost their data after page refresh.
- Removed API key exposure from console logs in 'src/lib/firebase.ts' and 'app/page.tsx' for improved security.
- Fixed API route imports in 'app/api/ai/parse/route.ts' to use relative paths instead of path aliases, resolving 500 errors during AI task creation.
- Installed 'chrono-node' and updated 'src/lib/parseTask.ts' to offload date parsing from AI to 'chrono-node', handling fuzzy phrases and providing default times (e.g., morning: 9:00, afternoon: 12:00, night/evening: 20:00).
- Updated 'app/api/ai/parse/route.ts' to use the new parsing logic and resolve dates with 'chrono-node', ensuring tasks are added to Firestore with correct date formats.
- Modified 'src/lib/firestore.ts' to remove client-side 'auth.currentUser' checks, accepting 'userId' as a parameter for server-side compatibility.
- Harmonized 'Task' and 'TaskInput' types in 'src/lib/types.ts', adding 'userId' for server-side use.
- Enhanced system prompt in 'src/lib/parseTask.ts' to reflect Gorlea as an energetic AI assistant, improving task description engagement.
- Added environment variable validation in 'src/lib/parseTask.ts' and 'src/lib/firebase.ts' to prevent runtime errors due to missing keys.
- Improved accessibility in 'components/chat-modal.tsx' and 'components/add-task-modal.tsx' by adding 'aria-describedby' to dialog components.
- Enhanced 'components/chat-modal.tsx' with textarea for multi-line input and automatic line wrapping for better user experience.
- Added clean, minimal confirmation message in AI chat after task creation with "✅ Task created!" message.
- Added minimal toast notification for AI task creation with "✅ Task created" message.
- Modified 'components/add-task-modal.tsx' to close automatically after task creation for a smoother workflow.

## Next Steps

1. Continue testing the AI task creation flow which is now working correctly with 'chrono-node' integration for date parsing.
2. Address any remaining security concerns by removing debug logging of sensitive information before production deployment.
3. Implement optimistic UI updates for AI task creation to further improve user experience.
4. Continue with Phase 5 of the roadmap for daily email digest functionality after confirming stability of current updates.
5. Ensure all memory bank files are kept up-to-date with the latest state and testing outcomes for seamless handoff.

## Active Decisions & Considerations

- Implemented a secure approach for Firebase configuration using environment variables with fallbacks to default values, allowing the app to work in development without exposing secrets in the repository.
- Continue monitoring task completion functionality to ensure metadata is properly preserved in both UI state and Firestore.
- Maintain documentation consistency with project style, focusing on detailed updates for testing phases to support future development.
- Consider implementing additional error handling for edge cases in the AI task creation flow.
- Removed console logs that exposed sensitive information while keeping the hardcoded configuration for development purposes.
