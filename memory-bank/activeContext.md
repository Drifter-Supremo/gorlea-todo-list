# Active Context: Gorlea Tasks

## Current Work Focus

- Successfully integrated OpenAI's GPT-4.1-mini for natural language task input parsing, replacing Gemini API due to persistent integration issues.
- Resolving UI issues such as task persistence after logout and profile picture display in the app bar.
- Updating documentation and memory bank to reflect all recent changes and troubleshooting efforts for continuity.

## Recent Changes

- Replaced Gemini API integration with OpenAI's GPT-4.1-mini in 'app/api/ai/parse/route.ts' after facing persistent 500 errors with Gemini. Updated environment variables to use `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `OPENAI_MODEL`.
- Updated 'src/lib/parseTask.ts' to use OpenAI client for task parsing with appropriate error handling.
- Modified 'components/chat-modal.tsx' to call the API route '/api/ai/parse' for natural language task processing.
- Fixed task persistence after logout in 'app/page.tsx' by clearing the tasks state when no user is logged in, ensuring the "no tasks yet" state is displayed.
- Investigated and resolved profile picture display issue in 'components/app-bar.tsx', confirming it now works correctly after user feedback.

## Next Steps

1. Test the full task creation flow via AI chat with OpenAI integration to ensure parsing accuracy and task addition to Firestore.
2. Address any remaining UI bugs or issues as reported by the user.
3. Continue with Phase 5 of the roadmap for daily email digest functionality.
4. Ensure all memory bank files are kept up-to-date with the latest state and troubleshooting outcomes for seamless handoff.

## Active Decisions & Considerations

- Prioritize testing of OpenAI integration to confirm stability and accuracy in natural language task parsing.
- Maintain focus on user feedback to confirm fixes (e.g., profile picture now displaying correctly) before proceeding to next phases.
- Keep documentation consistent with project style and updated with all session outcomes for future reference.
