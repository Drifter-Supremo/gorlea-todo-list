# Active Context: Gorlea Tasks

## Current Work Focus

- Attempting integration of Gemini API for natural language task input parsing, currently facing persistent 500 errors.
- Resolving UI issues such as task persistence after logout and profile picture display in the app bar.
- Updating documentation and memory bank to reflect all recent changes and troubleshooting efforts for continuity.

## Recent Changes

- Attempted multiple configurations for Gemini API integration in 'app/api/ai/parse/route.ts', including endpoint variations and API key naming adjustments (checked both `NEXT_PUBLIC_GEMINI_KEY` and `GEMINI_API_KEY`).
- Fixed task persistence after logout in 'app/page.tsx' by clearing the tasks state when no user is logged in, ensuring the "no tasks yet" state is displayed.
- Investigated and resolved profile picture display issue in 'components/app-bar.tsx', confirming it now works correctly after user feedback.
- Enhanced error logging in API endpoint to provide detailed responses for debugging Gemini integration issues.

## Next Steps

1. Continue troubleshooting Gemini API integration by analyzing detailed error responses from the network tab or server logs to resolve 500 errors.
2. Revisit AI parsing integration once UI issues are fully resolved, potentially exploring alternative AI services if Gemini issues persist.
3. Test the full task creation flow via AI chat once the real API integration is successful.
4. Ensure all memory bank files are kept up-to-date with the latest state and troubleshooting outcomes for seamless handoff.

## Active Decisions & Considerations

- Prioritize resolving UI issues (task persistence, profile picture) before finalizing AI integration to ensure a stable user experience.
- Maintain detailed error logging in API responses to aid in debugging without direct terminal access.
- Focus on user feedback to confirm fixes (e.g., profile picture now displaying correctly) before proceeding to next phases.
- Keep documentation consistent with project style and updated with all session outcomes for future reference.
