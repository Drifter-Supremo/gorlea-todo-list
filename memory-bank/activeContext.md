# Active Context: Gorlea Tasks

## Current Work Focus

- Integrating AI parsing for natural language task input via a mock endpoint.
- Resolving runtime errors related to invalid due date values in task rendering.
- Ensuring all components use relative import paths to avoid "Cannot find module" errors.
- Updating documentation and memory bank for seamless handoff and continuity.

## Recent Changes

- Fixed "Invalid time value" error in 'components/task-row.tsx' by adding checks for invalid due dates.
- Created mock API endpoint '/api/ai/parse' to simulate AI parsing for chat input, extracting title, details, due date, and priority based on natural language cues.
- Updated 'src/lib/parseTask.ts' to send proper POST requests to the mock endpoint.
- Enhanced 'src/components/chat-modal.tsx' with state management and error handling for AI task creation.
- Converted alias imports to relative paths across multiple components to resolve module resolution errors.
- Updated 'src/lib/firestore.ts' to handle due date conversion from Firestore Timestamps to JavaScript Date objects.

## Next Steps

1. Implement actual AI logic using Gemini API for natural language parsing in '/api/ai/parse'.
2. Test the full task creation flow via AI chat to ensure seamless integration.
3. Address any remaining "Cannot find module" errors by verifying TypeScript cache and IDE settings.
4. Continue updating documentation for all changes and ensure memory bank reflects the latest state.

## Active Decisions & Considerations

- Prioritize mock implementation for AI parsing to ensure functionality before real API integration.
- Maintain consistent use of relative paths for imports to avoid alias resolution issues.
- Focus on robust error handling for date values and API calls to prevent white screen errors.
- Keep documentation up-to-date for smooth AI and human handoff.
