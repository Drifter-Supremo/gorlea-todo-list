# Product Context: Gorlea Tasks

## Why This Project Exists

Gorlea Tasks was created to address the need for a smarter, more intuitive task management experience. Traditional to-do apps require manual entry and organization, which can be tedious and inefficient. Gorlea Tasks leverages AI to streamline task input, organization, and follow-up, reducing friction and helping users stay productive.

## Problems It Solves

- Manual task entry is slow and error-prone.
- Users struggle to keep tasks organized and prioritized.
- Existing tools lack intelligent suggestions and contextual assistance.
- Synchronization and accessibility across devices is often unreliable.
- Many apps are cluttered or lack a clean, distraction-free interface.

## How It Should Work

- Users enter tasks in natural language (e.g., "Call John tomorrow at 2 PM").
- The system parses and extracts details like due dates, priorities, and categories automatically (Phase 3, in progress).
- An integrated AI assistant (Gorlea) helps with task management, suggestions, and productivity queries.
- Tasks are categorized and prioritized intelligently.
- The UI is minimal, responsive, and supports both light and dark modes.
- Tasks sync seamlessly across devices and work offline.
- All Firestore CRUD, time picker, mobile/desktop UX, and edit/delete features are complete and live.
- Documentation/memory bank is up to date for AI or developer handoff.

## User Experience Goals

- Frictionless task entry and management.
- High parsing accuracy for natural language input.
- Contextually relevant AI assistance.
- Reliable cross-device sync and offline support.
- Minimalist, responsive, and accessible design.
