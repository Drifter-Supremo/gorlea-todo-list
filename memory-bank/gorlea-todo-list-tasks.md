Gorlea Tasks â€” MVP Roadmap

> All steps are mandatory, including email notifications.

Work through each checkbox sequentially. Mark as complete when finished, commit, and push.

---

Phase 0 â€“ Project & Secrets Setup

[x] 0.1 Create/clean repo & branch

[x] 0.2 Add .env.local with keys:

NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=

NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=

NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=

NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=

NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=

GEMINI_API_KEY=

[x] 0.3 Add .env.local & credentials.txt to .gitignore, then delete credentials.txt

[x] 0.4 Commit â†’ chore: move secrets to env

---

Phase 1 â€“ Clientâ€‘Side Firebase Bootstrap

[x] 1.1 npm install firebase @react-oauth/google @google/generative-ai date-fns --legacy-peer-deps

[x] 1.2 Create lib/firebase.ts â€” export app, auth, db

[x] 1.3 Create hooks/useAuth.tsx â€” wrap onAuthStateChanged, expose login() / logout()

[x] 1.4 Wire app-bar.tsx to display user avatar & Google signâ€‘in/out buttons

Phase 1.5 â€“ Styling Tokens

[x] 1.5.1 Add Tailwind variables to globals.css:

:root {
--bg-primary:#032934;
--text-main:#F5E8C2;
--accent:#F29600;
}

[ ] 1.5.2 Verify colors across all components

---

Phase 2 â€“ Firestore CRUD Helpers

[x] 2.1 Firestore CRUD helpers implemented in lib/firestore.ts (addTask, getTasks, updateTask, deleteTask). All now use per-user subcollections: tasks are stored under users/{userId}/tasks.
[x] 2.2 Frontend updated to use helpers and fetch only the signed-in user's tasks. Verified: logging in/out with different accounts shows only that user's tasks.
[x] 2.3 Update task-row.tsx checkbox to call toggleComplete
    - (Implemented via parent handler: toggling the checkbox updates Firestore for the current user. This follows React best practices.)
[x] 2.4 Add/Edit Task modal: time picker (15-min increments, mobile/desktop friendly)
[x] 2.5 Mobile long-press on task row opens modal with Edit/Delete actions
[x] 2.6 Minimal delete confirmation dialog (all devices)
[x] 2.7 Edit modal improvements: pre-filling, unified for add/edit
[x] 2.8 Fixed task persistence after logout by clearing tasks state when no user is logged in

_Note: listenTasks (real-time) not yet implemented; currently using getTasks for one-time fetch. Multi-user storage is complete and tested as of 2025-04-29._

Phase 3 â€“ OpenAI GPT-4.1-mini Integration

[x] 3.1 Install OpenAI client and update environment variables with `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `OPENAI_MODEL`.

[x] 3.2 Update 'src/lib/parseTask.ts' to use OpenAI client for natural language parsing with system prompt: "Convert the userâ€™s sentence into JSON â†’ {title, details, dueDate (ISO), priority(low|medium|high)}. Return ONLY the JSON."

[x] 3.3 Update 'app/api/ai/parse/route.ts' to call the new parsing function and handle API requests.

[x] 3.4 Test local integration to ensure task parsing works with OpenAI API.

---

Phase 4 â€“ AI Parsing Integration

[x] 4.1 In 'components/chat-modal.tsx':
    - Call API route '/api/ai/parse' for natural language input processing.
    - On success, invoke addTask() with returned JSON to add the task to Firestore.

[ ] 4.2 Implement optimistic UI updates & error toasts via shadcn useToast

---

Phase 5 â€“ Daily Email Digest (MANDATORY NOTIFICATIONS)

[ ] 5.1 Install Firebase Trigger Email extension OR create scheduled Pub/Sub Cloud Function (pubsub.schedule('0 8 * * *'))

[ ] 5.2 Query tasks due/overdue for each user and send digest email via Nodemailer (Gmail App Password)

[ ] 5.3 Verify email receipt and content accuracy

---

Phase 6 â€“ Deploy to Vercel

[ ] 6.1 Push repo to GitHub & connect to Vercel

[ ] 6.2 Add all .env keys in Vercel â†’ Environment Variables

[ ] 6.3 Ensure build settings: npm run build (output .next)

[ ] 6.4 Configure vercel.json or rewrites to proxy Firebase Functions

[ ] 6.5 Visit live URL â†’ test auth, CRUD, AI parsing, email digests

[ ] 6.6 Create Git tag mvp-live  ![ðŸŽ‰](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/16.0/1f389/72.png)

## Future Enhancements

- Task filtering and sorting
- Task editing (via details modal)
- Task deletion (delete icon on desktop, long-press on mobile)
- Task categories/tags
- User authentication
- Data persistence
- Calendar view
- Notifications
- Advanced AI features (task suggestions, reminders, etc.)

- Task cards: only title and due date shown on mobile, delete icon hidden for cleaner look.
- Details modal for editing and viewing full info; long-press on mobile shows only delete.
- All UI labels use "Details" instead of "Description."
