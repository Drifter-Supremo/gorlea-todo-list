# Progress: Gorlea Tasks

## What Works

- Project documentation (projectbrief.md, productContext.md, activeContext.md, systemPatterns.md, techContext.md) is scaffolded and updated.
- MVP roadmap and technical requirements are clearly defined.
- Initial project structure and planning are complete.
- Environment and secrets setup complete.
- All core dependencies installed (Firebase, Google OAuth, OpenAI, date-fns).
- Firebase initialized (lib/firebase.ts).
- Authentication hook implemented (hooks/useAuth.tsx).
- Firestore CRUD helpers fully implemented and integrated with UI.
- Add/Edit Task modal supports time picker (15-min increments, mobile/desktop friendly).
- Task cards: only title and due date shown on mobile, delete icon hidden for cleaner look.
- Details modal for editing and viewing full info; long-press on mobile shows only delete.
- All UI labels use "Details" instead of "Description."
- Minimal delete confirmation dialog (all devices).
- Edit modal improvements: pre-filling, unified for add/edit.
- Fixed "Invalid time value" error in task rendering by handling invalid due dates.
- Created mock API endpoint for AI parsing, simulating natural language task input processing.
- Updated chat modal with state management and error handling for task creation via AI.
- Fixed task persistence after logout by clearing tasks state when no user is logged in.
- Resolved profile picture display issue in app bar, confirmed working after user feedback.
- Successfully integrated OpenAI's GPT-4.1-mini for natural language task parsing, replacing Gemini due to integration issues.
- All changes tested and committed/pushed to repo.

## What's Left to Build

- Implement optimistic UI updates and error toasts for AI task creation.
- Establish daily email digest functionality.
- Prepare for deployment to Vercel and production testing.
- Implement future enhancements: task filtering, categories, calendar view, notifications, advanced AI features.

## Current Status

- Project is in Phase 4: AI parsing integration with OpenAI's GPT-4.1-mini (completed core integration, pending optimistic UI updates and error toasts).
- All Phase 2 features (Firestore CRUD, time picker, mobile/desktop UX, edit/delete) are complete and live in main branch.
- UI issues (task persistence after logout, profile picture display) have been resolved and confirmed working.
- Documentation and memory bank files are up to date for AI or new developer handoff.

## Known Issues

- Some "Cannot find module" errors may persist due to TypeScript cache or IDE issues, resolvable by restart or cache clearing.
- No deployed version available yet.
- Optimistic UI updates and error toasts for AI task creation are not yet implemented.

## May 2025

### Resolved
- Fixed path aliases in `tsconfig.json` to match project structure.
- Created placeholder components (`chat-modal.tsx`, `useAuth.tsx`).
- Fixed "Invalid time value" error in task rendering.
- Implemented mock AI parsing endpoint for chat task creation.
- Resolved task persistence after logout by clearing tasks state in `app/page.tsx`.
- Fixed profile picture display issue in `components/app-bar.tsx`, now displaying correctly.
- Successfully integrated OpenAI's GPT-4.1-mini for AI task parsing, replacing Gemini after persistent 500 errors.

### Pending
- Address any remaining "Cannot find module" errors via IDE restart or cache clearing.
- Implement optimistic UI updates and error toasts for AI task creation.
- Complete email digest functionality.
