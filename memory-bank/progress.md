# Progress: Gorlea Tasks

## What Works

- Project documentation (projectbrief.md, productContext.md, activeContext.md, systemPatterns.md, techContext.md) is scaffolded and updated.
- MVP roadmap and technical requirements are clearly defined.
- Initial project structure and planning are complete.
- Environment and secrets setup complete.
- All core dependencies installed (Firebase, Google OAuth, OpenAI, date-fns, chrono-node).
- Firebase initialized (lib/firebase.ts).
- Authentication hook implemented (hooks/useAuth.tsx).
- Firestore CRUD helpers fully implemented and integrated with UI.
- Add/Edit Task modal supports time picker (15-min increments, mobile/desktop friendly).
- Task cards: only title and due date shown on mobile, delete icon hidden for cleaner look.
- Details modal for editing and viewing full info; long-press on mobile shows only delete.
- All UI labels use "Details" instead of "Description."
- Minimal delete confirmation dialog (all devices).
- Edit modal improvements: pre-filling, unified for add/edit.
- Fixed "Invalid time value" error in task rendering by handling invalid due dates.
- Created mock API endpoint for AI parsing, simulating natural language task input processing.
- Updated chat modal with state management and error handling for task creation via AI.
- Fixed task persistence after logout by clearing tasks state when no user is logged in.
- Resolved profile picture display issue in app bar, confirmed working after user feedback.
- Successfully integrated OpenAI's GPT-4.1-mini for natural language task parsing, replacing Gemini due to integration issues.
- Integrated 'chrono-node' for enhanced date and time parsing, offloading date extraction from AI, with support for fuzzy phrases and default times.
- Refactored 'src/lib/firestore.ts' for server-side compatibility by removing client-side auth checks and accepting 'userId' as a parameter.
- Harmonized 'Task' and 'TaskInput' types in 'src/lib/types.ts' with 'userId' for consistency.
- Added environment variable validation in 'src/lib/parseTask.ts' and 'src/lib/firebase.ts' to prevent runtime errors.
- Improved accessibility in 'components/chat-modal.tsx' and 'components/add-task-modal.tsx' with 'aria-describedby'.
- Fixed Firebase initialization to work in both browser and server environments, enabling AI task creation.
- Fixed task completion issue to preserve all task metadata when tasks are marked as complete.
- Improved chat modal with textarea for multi-line input and automatic line wrapping.
- Added confirmation message in AI chat after task creation with clean, minimal UI.
- Modified add task modal to close automatically after task creation.
- Implemented overdue task feature to display past-due tasks with "Overdue" label and red badge.
- Updated task list to sort overdue tasks at the top for better visibility.
- Simplified date handling by allowing users to create tasks with any date (past or future) without validation restrictions.
- All changes tested and committed/pushed to repo.

## What's Left to Build

- Implement optimistic UI updates for AI task creation.
- Establish daily email digest functionality.
- Prepare for deployment to Vercel and production testing.
- Implement future enhancements: task filtering, categories, calendar view, notifications, advanced AI features.

## Current Status

- Project is in Phase 4: AI parsing integration with OpenAI's GPT-4.1-mini and 'chrono-node' for date parsing (completed core integration and UI improvements, pending optimistic UI updates).
- All Phase 2 features (Firestore CRUD, time picker, mobile/desktop UX, edit/delete) are complete and live in main branch.
- UI issues (task persistence after logout, profile picture display) have been resolved and confirmed working.
- Documentation and memory bank files are up to date for AI or new developer handoff.

## Known Issues

- Some "Cannot find module" errors may persist due to TypeScript cache or IDE issues, resolvable by restart or cache clearing.
- No deployed version available yet.
- Optimistic UI updates for AI task creation are not yet implemented.
- API keys are exposed in console logs when debugging is enabled - should be removed for production.

## May 2025

### Resolved
- Fixed path aliases in `tsconfig.json` to match project structure.
- Created placeholder components (`chat-modal.tsx`, `useAuth.tsx`).
- Fixed "Invalid time value" error in task rendering.
- Implemented mock AI parsing endpoint for chat task creation.
- Resolved task persistence after logout by clearing tasks state in `app/page.tsx`.
- Fixed profile picture display issue in `components/app-bar.tsx`, now displaying correctly.
- Successfully integrated OpenAI's GPT-4.1-mini for AI task parsing, replacing Gemini after persistent 500 errors.
- Integrated 'chrono-node' in 'src/lib/parseTask.ts' for improved date parsing with error handling and fuzzy phrase support.
- Updated 'src/lib/firestore.ts' to remove client-side auth checks for server-side compatibility.
- Harmonized types in 'src/lib/types.ts' and added 'userId' for server-side task management.
- Added environment variable validation in 'src/lib/parseTask.ts' and 'src/lib/firebase.ts'.
- Enhanced accessibility in dialog components with 'aria-describedby'.
- Fixed Firebase initialization in 'src/lib/firebase.ts' to work in both browser and server environments, enabling AI task creation.
- Modified 'src/lib/firestore.ts' to properly handle the 'completed' property when updating tasks.
- Updated 'app/page.tsx' to preserve all task metadata when tasks are marked as complete.
- Removed API key exposure from console logs in 'src/lib/firebase.ts' for improved security.
- Fixed API route imports in 'app/api/ai/parse/route.ts' to use relative paths instead of path aliases.
- Improved chat modal in 'components/chat-modal.tsx' with textarea for multi-line input and automatic line wrapping.
- Added clean, minimal confirmation message in AI chat after task creation.
- Added toast notification for AI task creation with minimal design.
- Modified add task modal in 'components/add-task-modal.tsx' to close automatically after task creation.
- Implemented overdue task feature in 'components/task-row.tsx' to display "Overdue" label with red badge for past-due tasks.
- Updated 'components/task-list.tsx' to sort overdue tasks at the top of the task list for better visibility.
- Simplified date handling by removing date validation in both the chat modal and add task modal, allowing users to create tasks with any date.

### Pending
- Address any remaining "Cannot find module" errors via IDE restart or cache clearing.
- Implement optimistic UI updates for AI task creation.
- Complete email digest functionality.
- Test the full task creation flow with 'chrono-node' integration for date parsing accuracy.
- Remove any remaining debug logging of sensitive information before production deployment.
