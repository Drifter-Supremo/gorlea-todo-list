# Progress: Gorlea Tasks

## What Works

- Project documentation (projectbrief.md, productContext.md, activeContext.md, systemPatterns.md, techContext.md) is scaffolded.
- MVP roadmap and technical requirements are clearly defined.
- Initial project structure and planning are complete.
- Environment and secrets setup complete.
- All core dependencies installed (Firebase, Google OAuth, Gemini, date-fns).
- Firebase initialized (lib/firebase.ts).
- Authentication hook implemented (hooks/useAuth.tsx).
- Firestore CRUD helpers fully implemented and integrated with UI.
- Add/Edit Task modal supports time picker (15-min increments, mobile/desktop friendly).
- Task cards: only title and due date shown on mobile, delete icon hidden for cleaner look.
- Details modal for editing and viewing full info; long-press on mobile shows only delete.
- All UI labels use "Details" instead of "Description."
- Minimal delete confirmation dialog (all devices).
- Edit modal improvements: pre-filling, unified for add/edit.
- All changes tested and committed/pushed to repo.

## What's Left to Build


- Authentication wired to UI (app-bar.tsx).
- Tailwind color variables added (globals.css).
- UI ready for further color refactoring if desired.
- Integrate Gemini AI parsing for natural language task input.
- Establish daily email digest functionality.
- Prepare for deployment to Vercel and production testing.
- Implement future enhancements: task filtering, details field, categories, calendar view, notifications, advanced AI features.

## Current Status

- Project is now in Phase 3: Gemini AI parsing integration (Cloud Function, natural language task input).
- All Phase 2 features (Firestore CRUD, time picker, mobile/desktop UX, edit/delete) are complete and live in main branch.
- Documentation and memory bank are fully up to date for AI or developer handoff.

## Known Issues

- Gemini integration pending (Phase 3, in progress).
- No deployed version available yet.

## May 2025

### Resolved
- Fixed path aliases in `tsconfig.json` to match actual folder structure (no file moves)
- Created placeholder components (`chat-modal.tsx`, `useAuth.tsx`)

### Pending
- Address missing exports: `DialogContent`, `updateTask`, `deleteTask`
- Implement chat modal interaction logic
- Add accessibility props to `DialogContent`
